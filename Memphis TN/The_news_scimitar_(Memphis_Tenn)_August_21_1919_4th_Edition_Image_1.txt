President<br />Wilson has not the power to declare<br />peace by proclamation, nor could hs<br />consent In any circumstances to take<br />such a course prior to the ratification<br />of a formal treaty of peace by the sen<br />ate. The president bo wrote Senator<br />Fall today in answer to one of the 20<br />written questions the senator present<br />ed at the White House conference<br />Tuesday.<br />Replying to another question the<br />president said the provision of the<br />treaty that it should come into force<br />after ratification by Germany and three<br />of the principal associated powers<br />operated merely .to establish peace be<br />tween those ratifying powers and that<br />It was &quot;questionable whether It<br />can be said that the league, of nations<br />is In any true sense created by the as<br />sociation of only three of the billed and<br />associated governments.&quot;<br />As to the question of when normal<br />conditions might he restored, the presi<br />dent said he could only express the<br />confident opinion that immediate rati<br />fication of the treaty and acceptance<br />of the covenant of the league as written<br />would &quot;certainly within the near future<br />reduce the cost of living&quot; both In this<br />country and abroad through the re<br />storation of production and commerce<br />to normal.<br />To Senator Fall&#39;s questions relating<br />to the disposition of Germsny&#39;s pos<br />sessions, the president said the<br />treaty conveyed no title to the<br />allied or associated powers, but<br />merely &quot;intrusts disposition of the<br />territory In question to their decision.&quot;<br />&quot;Germany&#39;s renunciation In favor of<br />the principal allied and associated pow<br />ers, the president continued, &quot;of her<br />rights and titles to her overseas pos<br />sessions Is meant similarly to, operate<br />as vesting in those powers a trustee<br />ship with respect of their final dispo<br />sition and government.&quot;<br />&quot;There nan been a provisional agree<br />ment,&quot; the president added, In this con<br />nection, &quot;as to the disposition of these<br />overseas possessions, whose confirma<br />tion and execution is dependent upon<br />the approval of the league of nations<br />andthe United States Is party to that<br />provisional agreement.<br />Explains Agreement, &#39;<br />The president said) the only agree<br />ment between France and Great Britain<br />with regard to African territory, of<br />4. .which hQwe cognisant, conoerued ra-<br />aisposmon oi rignis aireaay possessea<br />hy them on that, continent.<br />, It was deemed wise, he said, that the<br />United States should be represented<br />bv one member of the commission for<br />settling the new- frontier lines of Bel<br />glum, and Germany &quot;because of the<br />universal opinion that America&#39;s repre<br />sentative would add to the commission<br />a useful element of entirely disinter<br />ested judgment.&#39;.&#39;- The same thought<br />applied, he added, to appointment of<br />an American representative on the com<br />mission set up to exercise authority<br />over the plebiscite In upper Silesia.<br />The- president wrote the senator hs<br />had no -official Information as to<br />whether .Norway, Sweden, . Penmark,<br />Holland or Switzerland would join the<br />league.<br />1 The president&#39;s letter follows:<br />&quot;My Dear Senator Fall You left Ves<br />terday In my hands certain written<br />questions which I promised you I would<br />answer. I am hastening to fulfill that<br />promise. &#39;<br />&quot;I feel constrained to say In reply to<br />your first question not only that In my<br />judgment I have not the power by<br />proclamation to declare that peace ex<br />ists, but that I could In no clroum<br />stances consent to take such a course<br />prior to the ratification of a formal<br />treaty of peace.

This measure has the approval<br />of Secretary Baker and Oan. March,<br />chief of staff, and Is based on the fact<br />that the feat performed by Sergt.
