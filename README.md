Currently the process is being slowed down by needing to manually pull urls, convert them into OCR files via excel, and then putting that csv with the OCR links into the webscraper.
Hoping to automate this process and pull links directly from webpage but having some difficulty. 
Also having output issues, where text files are outputting in HTML. Need to fix this!
